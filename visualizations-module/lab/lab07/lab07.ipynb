    "So far, we have discussed methods to interpret the data, but what if we want to present our data in a visual format? In this lab, you'll learn several important table methods for producing data visualizations. **Visualizations** are some of the most powerful tools in data science; they're helpful for showing data to people who don't necessarily have a background in data science, and allow data scientists like yourselves to help others understand the data in a more intuitive way.\n",
