## Workshop Goals

Participants will learn how to:

- Use plotting libraries in Python
- Visualize categorical and numerical variables
- Understand key principles of effective visual communication
- Analyze real-world datasets to uncover meaningful insights

## Case Study Focus

This session uses the [1973 UC Berkeley graduate admissions dataset](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/dataset/berkeley/) to explore:

- Simpsonâ€™s Paradox and the importance of disaggregated data
- How visualization can both reveal and obscure patterns
- The role of social context in interpreting data
