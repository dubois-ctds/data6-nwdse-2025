# Data 6: National Workshop on Data Science Education (June 25)

Welcome! This repository contains Data 6 materials presented at the **National Workshop on Data Science Education (NWDSE)** hosted by [UC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/nwdse).

These resources are part of the **Data 6** curriculum and are designed to support instructors, educators, and workshop participants interested in introductory data science education.

## Wed June 25 2025 Workshop Overview

We are offering **two in-person workshops**:

### 9:30 AM - Data Science Fundamentals

This workshop introduces participants to the basics of working with data using tools like **Kaggle** and **Google Sheets**. This is one of the first activities that students encounter in the class. Attendees will learn how to find datasets, explore them in spreadsheet environments, and pose meaningful, ethical questions using real-world data.  

_Workshop materials can be found under: [`/fundamentals-workshop/README.md`](/fundamentals-workshop/README.md)_

### 10:30 AM - Introduction to Visualizations

In this session, we dive into the essentials of **data visualization** using Python and Jupyter notebooks. This activity occurs about midway through the course, after students have grasped the basics of handling table data in Python. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of visualizations through the Bickel Case Study.

_Workshop materials can be found under: [`/visualizations-workshop/README.md`](/visualizations-workshop/README.md)_

## Download the Curriculum

We are offering access to the curriculum for the **Fundamentals** and **Visualizations** modules of the Data 6 curriculum. 
The two modules' curriculum are located across two resources:
* GitHub repository ([direct link](https://github.com/dubois-ctds/data6-nwdse-2025)): All Jupyter notebooks used in lectures, homeworks, and labs.
